/**
 * Data class which describes a single key and its attributes.

 *  data passed to the system. Defaults to 0.
 * @property label The string used to display the key in the UI. Is not used for the actual data
 *  passed to the system. Should normally be the exact same as the [code]. Defaults to an empty
